Drop rule 'vm301-must-be-on-node1', because at least one resource is in a positive resource affinity rule and there are other resources in at least one other node affinity rule already.
Drop rule 'vm301-must-be-on-node2', because at least one resource is in a positive resource affinity rule and there are other resources in at least one other node affinity rule already.
Drop rule 'vm301-vm302-must-be-kept-together', because resources are in multiple node affinity rules.
Drop rule 'vm401-must-be-on-node1', because at least one resource is in a negative resource affinity rule and this rule would restrict these to less nodes than available to the resources.
Drop rule 'vm401-vm402-must-be-kept-separate', because two or more resources are restricted to less nodes than available to the resources.
Drop rule 'vm402-must-be-on-node1', because at least one resource is in a negative resource affinity rule and this rule would restrict these to less nodes than available to the resources.
Drop rule 'vm501-must-be-on-node1', because at least one resource is in a positive resource affinity rule and there are other resources in at least one other node affinity rule already.
Drop rule 'vm501-vm502-must-be-kept-together', because resources are in multiple node affinity rules.
Drop rule 'vm502-vm503-must-be-kept-together', because resources are in multiple node affinity rules.
Drop rule 'vm503-must-be-on-node2', because at least one resource is in a positive resource affinity rule and there are other resources in at least one other node affinity rule already.
